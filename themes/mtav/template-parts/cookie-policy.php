    <h5>MORETHANAVOTE.ORG COOKIE POLICY OF USE</h5>
    <p>Our Cookie Policy</p>
    <p class="one-tab">More Than A Vote Organization, Inc (“MTAV,” “us,” “we,” or “our”) uses cookies and similar technologies (“tracking technologies”) on the <a href="//morethanavote.org">www.morethanavote.org</a> website and associated web pages and applications (the “Site”). This Cookie Policy explains what cookies are and how we use them, what is Do Not Track, and your choices regarding cookies and similar technologies.</p>
    <p>What are cookies and how do we use them?</p>
    <p class="one-tab">A “cookie” is a small piece of information stored on your device when you visit a website. Cookies allow our Site to remember you and how you’ve used the Site every time you come back. A cookie can be a “persistent” or “session” cookie. A “persistent” cookie will remain for a period of time set for that cookie. A “session-based” cookie is allocated only for the duration of your visit to our website and automatically expires when you close down your browser.</p>
    <p class="one-tab">We use cookies to do several things. For example, cookies are used to enable certain functions of the Site, enhance security, improve functionality of the Site, remember your preferences, or count the number of people visiting at the Site. We also use them to keep track of what you’ve done on the Site</p>
    <p class="one-tab">Our cookies fall into one the following categories or “types”:</p>
    <ol class="one-tab">
        <li>Strictly necessary – these are used to help make our Site work efficiently.</li>
        <li>Performance – these are used to analyze the way our Site works and how we can improve it.</li>
        <li>Functionality – these help to enhance your experience by doing things like remembering products you’ve added to your basket.</li>
        <li>Targeting/advertising – these may be used to share information with third parties who we advertise with, to identify the parts of the Site that you are interested in, to show you content we think may also be of interest to you, to tailor how we communicate with you, or to tailor the contents of the communications we send to you.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="one-tab">In addition to the cookies we use on our Site, we also use tracking technologies in some emails and notifications we send to you. These help us to understand whether you have opened the email and how you have interacted with it.</p>
    <p class="one-tab">If you want to know more about tracking technologies, head <a href="//aboutcookies.org" target="_blank">aboutcookies.org</a> or <a href="//allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">allaboutcookies.org</a> (please note that these sites are not operated by us).</p>
    <p>Do Not Track</p>
    <p class="one-tab">Do Not Track (DNT) is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. As there is no industry standard for DNT at this time, MTAV does not generally respond to “do not track” signals.</p>
    <p>Controlling your cookies and similar technologies</p>
    <p class="one-tab">You do not have to accept the cookies used by our Site. You can set your web browser to alert you when a cookie is 	being used, get information on the duration of the cookie and what server your data is being returned to, and choose to accept or reject the cookie. Additionally, you can set your browser to refuse all cookies or accept only cookies returned to the originating servers. Information on controlling and deleting cookies, including on a wide variety of browsers, is also available at <a href="//allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">allaboutcookies.org</a>. If you want to opt-out of cookies across different advertising networks, the Network Advertising Initiative website – <a href="//networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org</a> – has more information and guidance.</p>
    <p class="one-tab">Please know that some services may not function or may have more limited functionality if your web browser does not accept cookies.</p>

                    The campaign formally launced an ad that premiered during the NBA Eastern Final Conference Finals along with MTAV and LDF webpages directing users to sign up to serve as poll workers. Both websites and digital advertising directly linked user to sign up via Power the Polls.<br>
                    Since formally launching the campaign in mid-September, We Got Next has recruited 42,042 people who have signed up to serve as poll workers. Cities that normally face shortages, such as Atlanta and Philadelphia, ended up turning people away due to the flood of signups.

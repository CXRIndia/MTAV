                             One of the most immediate and critical needs in Black communities was safe places to vote in person. Our communities are far more vulnerable and threatened by Covid than white communities. Thanks to Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, MTAV was contacted early about a new push to open NBA arenas as voting locations because of their accessibility to communities of color and size, allowing for socially distanced voting at scale.Â¸

                            MTAV quickly mobilized to turn NBA arena voting into a national issue and used our collective influence and league relationships to get team owners, league officials, and community leaders to open their arenas. MTAV worked to make opening arenas league wide part of the demands to end the player strike. MTAV also helped lead the opening of Dodger Stadium, taking the cause outside the NBA. We worked with Live Nation to open concert venues as well.
